GENERAL INFORMATION
-------------------

This repository contains a very small Ada program the author wrote to test
GNATdoc [1].

At the time of this writing (2017-05-01), the author uses GNAT [2] and GNATdoc
under Debian Sid [3] and GNATdoc in Debian Sid is provided in the gnat-gps
package [4] (version 6.1.1-1).

HOW TO COMPILE THE PROGRAM
--------------------------

To build the program, and assuming you have cloned the repository to
~/gnatdoc_test, just open a terminal, change directory to ~/gnatdoc_test and
issue the following command:

$ make

This creates the executable program ("my_main", in the "bin" subdirectory).

HOW TO INVOKE GNATDOC TO GENERATE THE DOCUMENTATION
---------------------------------------------------

Just issue the following command:

$ make doc

This generates the documentation in the "generated_doc" subdirectory. Open the
"generated_doc/index.html" file in a browser to see the generated
documentation.

HOW TO REMOVE ALL THE FILES CREATED BY THE COMPILER OR GNATDOC
--------------------------------------------------------------

Just issue the following command (equivalent to re-cloning the repository):

$ make thorough_clean

DOCUMENTATION GENERATED USING DEBIAN PACKAGE gnat-gps (6.1.1-1) UNPATCHED
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The documentation generated using the Debian package gnat-gps (6.1.1-1)
unpatched is stored in the "generated_doc_before_patching" subdirectory.

This documentation (more precisely the documentation for the My_Package
package provided in the "generated_doc_before_patching/docs/my_package.html"
file) has the following inaccuracies:

1. The "not overriding" indicators appear as "overriding" indicators.

2. The line numbers shown for the subprogram declarations are wrong (one unit
   too high) if there is an "overriding" or a "not overriding" indicator on
   the previous line.

3. The rendering of the declaration of the Count subtype erroneously includes
   some preceding lines (here the "package My_Package is" line).

DOCUMENTATION GENERATED USING DEBIAN PACKAGE gnat-gps (6.1.1-1) PATCHED
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The documentation generated using the Debian package gnat-gps (6.1.1-1)
patched is stored in the "generated_doc_after_patching" subdirectory.

This documentation does not have the aforementioned inaccuracies.

PATCH
-----

The patch for the Debian package gnat-gps (6.1.1-1) is stored in the "patch"
subdirectory. This patch has been sent to the Debian Bug Tracking System (bug
